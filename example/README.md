# Vaadin 14 Groovy Builder Example App / Archetype

A port of [Vaadin Beverage Buddy](https://github.com/mvysny/beverage-buddy-vok)
to Groovy.

# Preparing Environment

The Vaadin 14 build requires node.js and npm. Vaadin Gradle plugin will install it for
you automatically (handy for the CI); alternatively you can install it to your OS:

* Windows: [node.js Download site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - use the .msi 64-bit installer
* Linux: `sudo apt install npm`

Also make sure that you have Java 8 (or higher) JDK installed.

## Getting Started

To quickly start the app, just type this into your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew clean build example:appRun
```

Gradle will automatically download an embedded servlet container (Jetty) and will run your app in it. Your app will be running on
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

We suggest you use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
to edit the project files. The Community edition is enough to run the server
via Gretty's `./gradlew appRun`. The Ultimate edition will allow you to run the
project in Tomcat - this is the recommended
option for a real development.

## Supported Modes

Runs in Vaadin 14 npm mode, using the [Vaadin Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin).

Both the [development and production modes](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/production/tutorial-production-mode-basic.html) are supported.
To prepare for development mode, just run:

```bash
./gradlew clean example:vaadinPrepareFrontend
```

To build in production mode, just run:

```bash
./gradlew clean build -Pvaadin.productionMode
```

If you don't have node installed in your CI environment, Vaadin Gradle plugin will
install it for you automatically.

# Workflow

To compile the entire project in production mode, run `./gradlew -Pvaadin.productionMode`.

To run the application in development mode, run `./gradlew clean build example:appRun` and open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

To produce a deployable production-mode WAR:
- run `./gradlew -Pvaadin.productionMode`
- You will find the WAR file in `example/build/libs/*.war`
- To revert your environment back to development mode, just run `./gradlew` or `./gradlew vaadinPrepareFrontend`
  (omit the `-Pvaadin.productionMode`) switch.

This will allow you to quickly start the example app and allow you to do some basic modifications.

## Development with Intellij IDEA Ultimate

The easiest way (and the recommended way) to develop Karibu-DSL-based web applications is to use Intellij IDEA Ultimate.
It includes support for launching your project in any servlet container (Tomcat is recommended)
and allows you to debug the code, modify the code and hot-redeploy the code into the running Tomcat
instance, without having to restart Tomcat.

1. First, download Tomcat and register it into your Intellij IDEA properly: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/defining-application-servers-in-intellij-idea.html
2. Then just open this project in Intellij, simply by selecting `File / Open...` and click on the
   `build.gradle` file. When asked, select "Open as Project".
2. You can then create a launch configuration which will launch this example app in Tomcat with Intellij: just
   scroll to the end of this tutorial: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/httpservlets.html
3. Start your newly created launch configuration in Debug mode. This way, you can modify the code
   and press `Ctrl+F9` to hot-redeploy the code. This only redeploys java code though, to
   redeploy resources just press `Ctrl+F10` and select "Update classes and resources"
